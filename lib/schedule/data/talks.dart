RenderFlex errors? No problem. Whether the Flexible in the Flex is going to flex depends on the FlexFit of the Flexible, and if it is going to be flexible then the amount it will flex within the Flex depends on the flex of the Flexible. But if the FlexFit of the Flexible says to ignore the flex, then it's all meaningless because it won't do anything. Clear as mud, right?
This is the talk you've been waiting for since the day you started Flutter. This is the talk that translates all of this jibberish into something a human being can understand. See you there!''',

If there is something that projects tend to ignore are TESTS. With the same mindset of Test Driven Development (TDD) we get Behavior Driven Development, but instead of writing tests we use a simple text definition for all tests with a language called Gherkin.

Scaling an app to thousands of daily active users is a dream come true, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. At Visible, we quickly realized that some of our assumptions about network connectivity and stability were too optimistic. Even a 0.5% failure rate would result in dozens of complaints related to network issues every day.

In this talk, I will share how we overcame this challenge by enabling our app with full offline capability while continuously adding new features for our users. I will dive deep into the technical details, discussing topics like GraphQL caching, background processing, and local storage.

Join me as I share our journey and offer valuable insights for Flutter developers looking to tackle similar challenges.''',

Flutter UI integration testing can be really cumbersome, especially in a mobile app that also depends on the native side features. Unfortunately, the Flutter integration test fails when a native permission dialog appears or we‚Äôd like to interact with some native platform view.

That‚Äôs why we created Patrol - an open-source framework for testing Flutter apps - developed by LeanCode. With Patrol, you can write your UI tests in Dart (like you would with integration_test), but you are enabled to test interactions with the native side - tap on native views, browse WebViews, and even interact with some other app on the device.

In this talk, we‚Äôll take a look at problems with integration testing, how Patrol solves them, and how you can use Patrol to supercharge your testing game.''',

Flutter is such an amazing cross-platform framework that it‚Äôs easy to forget about its connection with the underlying native platforms. For most of your Flutter journey, you won‚Äôt touch even a line of native code... until one day a client requires the use of an obscure SDK that doesn‚Äôt have a Flutter implementation, or you want to use that shiny new native feature before it gets official framework support. So, unwillingly, you reach for MethodChannels... but let me stop you right there. In this talk, I will show you a better, type-safe, and more enjoyable way to communicate with the native layer with the help of the pigeon code generation tool.''',

Creating beautiful UI has never been easier with Flutter. However, managing and organizing widgets effectively can pose challenges for developers, particularly when it comes to organizing them, testing them in all their different use cases, and maintaining design-code consistency. This is where Widgetbook comes in.

In this talk, we will see how we can use the open-source Flutter package Widgetbook to build our own design system/widget library and test our widgets across different devices, themes, and languages. We will connect our Figma designs directly to our Flutter widgets and set up a CI/CD integration with Widgetbook that simplifies the review process with designers. Thereby, we will learn how to keep design and code sync.

Key takeaways:

- How to build your own design system / widget library

- How to quickly test your widgets on different device sizes, themes, languages, etc.

- How to collaborate effectively with designers to keep design and code sync''',

With the rapid acceleration of digital technology adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, conversational AI solutions, including chatbots, virtual agents, and voice assistants, have gained significant popularity.

Phrases like 'Hey, Google!' and 'Ok, Google' have become some of the earliest words learned by children in today's generation. The preference for voice interaction with virtual assistants is growing rapidly, offering convenience to millions by saving time and reducing the cognitive burden associated with typing queries or tasks.

In this engaging talk, we will explore the diverse use cases of conversational AI and delve into the various methods and packages available to seamlessly integrate this powerful functionality into Flutter apps. By incorporating conversational AI, not only can you enhance the user experience, but you can also make your apps more accessible to a wider audience.''',
